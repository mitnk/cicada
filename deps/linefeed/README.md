`linefeed` is a configurable, concurrent, extensible, interactive input reader

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/linefeed/)

## This is a linefeed fork

cicada shell relies on linefeed [a lot](https://github.com/murarth/linefeed/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Amitnk).
As murarth got [no time](https://github.com/murarth/linefeed/issues/72) on
new updates, I forked it here to make changes for supporting for command line
highlighting etc.
